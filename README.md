## requirements
As a user, I would like to enter the 3 sides of a triangle using a Javascript prompt box.  After entering all the 3 sides of a triangle, I should get the following results using the alert box:

Equilateral: All sides are equal.
Isosceles: Exactly 2 sides are equal.
Scalene: No sides are equal.
NOT a triangle: The sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle is less than or equal to the length of the third side.

## dig deeper
This exercise does not test for degenerate triangles.
